    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Two years in New York.
    I came in New York in 2016. I was here some years ago and loved this city from the first breath. Since New York has changed in some ways, but its spirit still the same. It was one of my dream to live in this city and I almost complete it. Coming here I was not sure what field of activity to choose. So tried different of them and this year I came to the thought of starting to learn coding.</p>
